# Get to 100 (React)

This is a simple React application that allows users to play the "Get to 100" game. The objective of the game is to reach a score of 100 by clicking on a button that increments the score by a random value between 1 and 10.

## How to Play

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Click the "Increment Score" button to increase your score by a random value between 1 and 10.
3. Keep clicking the button until your score reaches 100.
4. If you go over 100, you lose the game and must start over.

## Features

- **Random Score Increment**: Each time you click the "Increment Score" button, your score increases by a random value between 1 and 10, making the game more challenging and unpredictable.
- **Score Tracking**: The application keeps track of your current score and displays it on the screen.
- **Win/Lose Condition**: If your score reaches exactly 100, you win the game. If your score goes over 100, you lose the game and must start over.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and works well on various screen sizes, including desktop and mobile devices.
